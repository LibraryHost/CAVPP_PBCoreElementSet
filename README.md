CAVPP PBCore Element Set (plugin for Omeka)
=====================================

Summary
-------

This plugin creates a custom element set and an output format for the [PBCore][1] standard
for the California Audiovisual Preservation Project.

**Note**: PBCore standard is not totally implemented: only items useful for
Omeka are added. Additional extension elements have been added for CAVPP internal use.

For more information on Omeka, see [Omeka][2].


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "CAVPP_PBCoreElementSet".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin. The plugin has no configuration.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It's always recommended to backup your database so you can roll back if needed.
